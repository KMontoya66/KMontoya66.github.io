### CPSC 120 

* Lab 1

    This is my favorite lab because it was the first lab I’ve ever done. I saw this as my first step into the world of computers and paired programming and it made me look forward to future labs. While it was a very simple “Hello, world” program, it meant a lot since it set the tone for me moving forward and what I could expect.

* Lab 7

    This is my second favorite lab because it was the first that seriously challenged and humbled me. The program was designed to check for parking during specific times and areas and I had a ton of fun figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it. In the end, me and my partner managed to figure it out in the end and it felt very satisfying getting it done and I really felt like I had improved.

* Lab 3, part 1

    This is my third favorite lab and the program was coded to calculate the number of days between a set dates. I found this program to be useful because for example, it let me know how much time I had to study for an upcoming test. It was also a fairly simple lab but I still felt like I learned a lot from doing it.
